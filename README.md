# Roughly Design

## Incentive plan

 * 1st commit: +100 MAK
 * 2nd commit: + X(1) MAK, the X(1) depends on the first commit.
 * n-th commit: + X(n-1) MAK, the X(n-1) depends on the (n-1) th commit.
 * X(n) = X(n-1) * C(n-1), 0.5 < C(n-1) < 1.5
 * C(n) is a quality coefficient for n-th commit. If the commit was good quality, C is larger than 1.0. On the other hand, if it was not so good, C is less than 1.0.
